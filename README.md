# CAPTAIN - Conservation Prioritization Through Artificial Intelligence

CAPTAIN is a Python program to optimize conservation and restoration planning using reinforcement learning.

The original CAPTAIN method is described in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00851-6) and released under [this license](https://github.com/captain-project/captain-project/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

The most recent version of CAPTAIN (v.2) is available [here](https://github.com/captain-project/captain2) and implements multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize policies simultaneously toward different targets, e.g. maximizing carbon sequestration and minimizing extinction risks. The method is describen in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.31.635975v2.abstract). 

Example files and script to setup an analysis are available [here](https://github.com/captain-project/example_data_captain2).
